						<p class="movie-name">House GUCCI</p>

						<p class="movie-description">The glamorous epic will cover a quarter of a century of the brand's history, starting in the 70s of the last century - when Maurizio Gucci crushed his grandfather's unpromising business. By the 1980s, he expanded his chain of boutiques to 153 stores, bringing the family half a billion dollars a year, but he never knew a real triumph: in 1995, after a bold fashion show for young designer Tom Ford, Maurizio was shot dead on the threshold of his own apartment.</p>

						<p class="movie-description">It's hard being a producer when you're a koala and you have paws. Even more difficult when your faithful assistant is older than a typewriter. And it’s really fun when your troupe is a plump dancing non-stop, a prickly punk girl, a shy schoolgirl, a big gangster and a mother of many children, whose children are pigs in the truest sense of the word. The recipe for success is simple - rush to the entertainment capital of the world, recruit a legendary rock musician and blow up the scene with a new show.</p>
